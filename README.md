# Word embeddings

Example of creating word embeddings with ngram and CBOW model using pytroch.

## Requirements

Have to be installed **python 3.9**. Install required libraries using requirements.txt and pip.

## Training 

Model trained on 1000 epochs, Intel Core i5 2.40Ghz CPU. For training data used first chapter of Harry Potter book.

## Results
